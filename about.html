<h3>About Me</h3>

Hello! Looks like you found my portfolio! Let me introduce myself. 
My name is Ezekiel Gutierrez, and if that's hard to pronounce you can just call me Zeke! 
I have a passion for learning new things, and spend most my free time studying programming, 
languages, art, and music!
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
Since childhood I've always wanted to be a software engineer. 
As a 5 year old I distinctly remember standing in awe behind my older brother as I watched him program in MS QuickBasic. 
I began reading books on programming before I even had a computer that I could use to code with. 
When I eventually had access to a computer for a few hours in the evenings, I would do everything to make the most of that time. 
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
Over the years I've written hundreds of programs that have taught me many different programming related skills. 
I'm most satisfied when I have a deep foundational understanding of something from the lowest level up. 
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;
I'm currently looking for an interesting low level programming job or something in game development where I can put my passion to work and express my creativity!
